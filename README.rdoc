= Rimcache - the Right-in-Memory Cache

"Caches" your commonly-used objects by just storing them frozen in a global hash.

  Rimcache.cache(:default_settings) do
    Settings.default
  end

It avoids a round-trip to Redis/memcache and serialization, so associations will stay loaded.

Expiration is coordinated between processes via `Rails.cache` or a configurable ActiveSupport::Cache::Store.
See +Rimcache::Config+ for configuration options.
